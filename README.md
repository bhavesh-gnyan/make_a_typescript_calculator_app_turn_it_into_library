 Title: Calculator Library in TypeScript

This repository contains a Typescript-based calculator application designed as a library. The project structure is organized into the following files and directories:

1. `calculator.ts` - Main implementation of the calculator functionality.
2. `index.d.ts` (src/types) - Type definitions for the library's public API.
3. `package.json` - Project metadata, dependencies, scripts, and configuration settings.
4. `README.md` - This file! Provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to use it.
5. `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configurations for building the library.
6. `build`, `dist` (subdirectories) - Output directories generated during compilation and packaging processes, respectively.
7. `docker_run.sh` (build/scripts) - Script to run Docker containers with the calculator application.
8. `Dockerfile` (build) - Container image definition for running the library in a containerized environment.
9. `src` (directory) - Contains all source code files and subdirectories related to the project.
10. `.gitignore` - Ignore file specifying which files/folders should not be tracked by Git.

To use this library, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Import the calculator module into your application code (e.g., `import Calculator from 'calculator-library'`).
3. Use the public API to perform calculations and access other functionalities provided by the library.
4. Build the project with `tsc -p tsconfig.json`. This will generate a compiled version of your code in the dist directory.
5. Run Docker containers using `./docker_run.sh` for testing or production purposes, depending on your needs.
6. Commit and push changes to GitHub as needed.
